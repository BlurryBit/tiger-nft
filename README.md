# The Bengal Tiger NFT

The Bengal tiger, also known as the Royal Bengal tiger, is a tiger from a specific population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies that is native to the Indian subcontinent.

This NFT is minted for Awareness on tiger preservation. Unfortunately, tigers have been facing extinction as a species. It is threatened by poaching, loss, and fragmentation of habitat, and was estimated at comprising fewer than 2,500 wild individuals by 2011. 

None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered large enough to support an effective population of more than 250 adult individuals. India's tiger population was estimated at 2,603–3,346 individuals by 2018.

Around 300–500 tigers are estimated in Bangladesh, 220–274 tigers in Nepal and 103 tigers in Bhutan.


 A part of this NFT sale (initial sale, as well as Royalties) will be donated to the World Wildlife Fund.
